# [Gefen: Optimized Stochastic Optimizer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2606.13894)

Gefen is a drop-in replacement for the AdamW optimizer for memory-efficient
training. It keeps the familiar AdamW training recipe while dramatically
reducing optimizer-state memory: an 8x reduction in AdamW memory footprint, or
about 6.5 GiB saved per billion parameters, while maintaining AdamW-level
performance. The reduced memory footprint lets you train larger models or use
larger batch sizes and, as a result, achieve higher training throughput.
All it takes is changing two lines of code: import Gefen and replace the AdamW
optimizer constructor.

## Installation

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install gefen
```

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ndvbd/Gefen
cd Gefen
pip install -e .
```

On the first CUDA run, Gefen builds its fused CUDA kernels with PyTorch JIT and
`nvcc`. This can take a few minutes. Later runs reuse the cached build for the
same Python, PyTorch, CUDA version, and Gefen source checkout.

This keeps the source install lightweight, but it requires a CUDA toolkit and
host compiler compatible with your PyTorch installation. In the future, we plan
to make this smoother with prebuilt wheels for common PyTorch/CUDA combinations.

## Quick Start

```python
import torch
from gefen import Gefen

device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
model = torch.nn.Linear(128, 10).to(device)

# optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(
optimizer = Gefen(  # Replace AdamW with Gefen:
    model.parameters(),
    lr=1e-3,
    betas=(0.9, 0.999),
    eps=1e-8,
    weight_decay=0.0,
)

inputs = torch.randn(32, 128, device=device)
targets = torch.randint(0, 10, (32,), device=device)

logits = model(inputs)
loss = torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy(logits, targets)
loss.backward()

optimizer.step()
optimizer.zero_grad(set_to_none=True)

print('Finished successfully.')
```

## Hugging Face Trainer

Until native `optim="gefen"` support is released in Transformers, pass Gefen to
the Trainer with `optimizer_cls_and_kwargs`:

```python
from gefen import Gefen
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="outputs",
    learning_rate=1e-3,
    weight_decay=0.0,
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    optimizer_cls_and_kwargs=(
        Gefen,
        {
            "lr": training_args.learning_rate,
            "betas": (training_args.adam_beta1, training_args.adam_beta2),
            "eps": training_args.adam_epsilon,
            "fused": True,
        },
    ),
)
```

### Distributed Training

Gefen is fully compatible with standard distributed training setups, including PyTorch DDP, PyTorch FSDP (including FSDP2 with `fully_shard`), and all flavors of DeepSpeed ZeRO. Gefen can be used like any other PyTorch optimizer in these workflows, with either `fused=True` or `fused=False`.


### Extension: Gefen-Muon

Based on the Gefen paradigm, a simple extension is to add a pseudo-orthogonalization step on the first moment, as Muon does, while skipping the second moment. This version, which is based on the PyTorch Muon implementation, immediately reduces Muon's optimizer-state footprint by 4x: the first moments are quantized to 8-bit using Gefen's Hessian-block-diagonal-inspired partitioning exact quantization, while performance remains similar to Muon.

You can use it exactly as you use Muon, with a simple constructor name replacement:

```python
from gefen import GefenMuon

optimizer = GefenMuon(
    [muon_parameter for _, muon_parameter in muon_parameter_pairs],
    lr=lr,
)
```

Our experiments show similar performance to Muon, with x4 less optimizer memory.
